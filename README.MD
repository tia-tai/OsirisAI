# OsirisAI
A simple voice assistant project using CustomTkinter, Python's SpeechRecognition library, Pyttsx3, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo.

## Installation
1. Download the `output` folder (You need both contents in the folder for the application to run)
2. Run `OsirisAI.exe`

## Disclaimer
This project was cut short as I lacked a GPU for training a specialized AI for the application. However, if in the future, when I manage to get my hands on a GPU, I'll return to this project to develop more specialized AI models for the application.
